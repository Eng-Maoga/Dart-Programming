# Dart Programming

This repository contains a collection of Dart programming exercises, examples, and coursework projects developed as part of my learning journey in mastering the Dart language. The code demonstrates key programming concepts, object-oriented principles, and foundational skills essential for building scalable applications and understanding Flutter development.

## üìò Overview

The purpose of this repository is to document my hands-on progress as I explore Dart programming concepts. Each file or folder represents a specific topic or exercise, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced applications.

Key learning areas include:
- Variables, data types, and operators
